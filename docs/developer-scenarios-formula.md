# Developer Scenarios & The Formula
## Common Scenarios
1. You are asked to create a new App
2. You are asked to create a new API
3. You are asked to modify an existing application
4. You are asked to fix a bug

Your next steps might be to gather requirements, work on a high level design, produce a POC or MVP. And when you start to write code, you may copy/paste, you may search and query for best results and code samples, etc. Copilot can help you do it all in one place. 

## The Formula
Scenario: "I want to build a web app that connects to a sql database and has an todo item api and then I want to deploy this app to Azure".

1. Context. Context. Context.
2. Well written natural language comments (in a code file) or prompts.
3. Multiple tabs open in the IDE with code files related to the work you are doing.
