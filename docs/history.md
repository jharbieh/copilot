# A Bit of History
AI > ML > DL > GI

* 1956 Artificial Intelligence (AI) - field of computer science that seeks to create intelligent machines that can replicate or exceed human intelligence
* 1997 Machine Learning (ML) - subset of AI that enables machines to learn from existing data and improve upon that data to make decisions or predictions
* 2017 Deep Learning (DL) - machine learning technique in which layers of neural networks are used to process data and make decisions
* 2021 Generative AI (GI) - a new class of AI that can generate new content, such as text, images, and code

## Machine Learning
Predictive models based on data and statistics
1. Anomaly Detection: Systems that detect unusual patterns or events, enabling pre-emptive action
2. Computer Visiion: Applications that interpret visual input from cameras, images or videos
3. Matural Language Processing: Applications that can interpret and draw insights from written or spoken language
4. Conversational AI: AI agents or bots that can engage in dialogs with human users

### Origins of Machine Learning
* 1950 - 1980's Symbolic AI
* 1990's Machine Learning
* 2010's Deep Learning

### What types of problems does machine learning help us solve?
- Spam and fraud detection
- Decision engines: approval or disapproval
- Recommendation engines: which one to choose
- Predictive maintenance: when will it break
- Image analysis: classification and object detection
- Text analysis: term and document comprehension
- Natural language processing and machine translation
