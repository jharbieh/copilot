# Recent (2024–2025) AI & Copilot Highlights
Curated headlines to capture major capability shifts. (Reverse‑chronological. Always verify current status—previews/features can change.)

## 2025
* Continued convergence of Microsoft Copilot experiences across M365, Windows, Security, Azure, GitHub (single brand surface) – ongoing refinements to unified UX and plugin/extension story.

## 2024
* GitHub Copilot Workspace (preview, Apr 2024): End‑to‑end natural language environment for planning, browsing, editing, and iterating on repo changes with AI assistance. [Citation: product preview announcement / docs – verify latest status]
* GitHub Copilot Extensions (Build 2024): Partner + service integrations (Azure, Docker, Sentry, DataStax, LaunchDarkly, Pinecone, Stripe, etc.) invoked directly inside Copilot Chat to reduce context‑switching. [1]
* Copilot+ PCs (May 2024): Windows devices with NPUs (40+ TOPS class) enabling hybrid (local + cloud) AI experiences (Recall preview adjustments, Cocreator, Live Captions translation). [2]
* GPT‑4o (May 2024): Unified multimodal (text / vision / audio) flagship model with lower latency & cost vs GPT‑4 Turbo; GPT‑4o mini introduced for cost‑efficient tasks. [3]
* Structured output & function/tool calling: Stable JSON / schema constrained responses, improved function calling semantics in OpenAI & Azure OpenAI. [4][5]
* Safety & policy refresh: Updated unified usage / safety policies & risk scorecards; expanded red‑teaming & modality guardrails. [6][3]
* Pricing & embeddings refresh: Adjusted pricing tiers; newer embedding families optimized for retrieval + reranking; cost reductions for lightweight reasoning. [7]
* RAG maturation: OSS frameworks (Semantic Kernel, LangChain) added richer memory abstractions, orchestration, evaluators, multi‑agent & tool integration patterns. [8][9]
* Azure OpenAI platform growth: Added GPT‑4 Turbo with Vision & GPT‑4o family plus expanded regional deployments & higher throughput tiers (see official Azure OpenAI release notes / docs). [Placeholder]
* Enterprise Copilot governance: Expanded policy controls (content filters, reference sources, telemetry), privacy enhancements, and trust center transparency for Chat suggestions & enterprise data boundaries. [10]
* GitHub Copilot Enterprise: Org knowledge integration (docs + code), central policy management, audit & reference features to reduce IP risk. [10]

### Tracking Model Lifecycle
Older / legacy OpenAI model variants scheduled for retirement in 2024 were superseded by GPT‑4 Turbo / GPT‑4o families and lighter mini models. Always consult official model deprecation schedules before pinning a version.

### Why These Matter
Themes: Lower latency, multimodality, ecosystem extensibility (extensions / plugins), responsible AI controls, hybrid (local + cloud) inference, and workflow integration (Workspace, Enterprise knowledge).
