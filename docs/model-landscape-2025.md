### Ranking Considerations
1. Frontier vs Open: Private frontier models still lead peak reasoning & multimodal coherence; gap is narrowing in coding & instruction.
2. Cost Efficiency: Sparse MoE (Mixtral) and small high‑quality SLMs (Phi‑3) shift optimization to cost per solved token, not raw benchmark peaks.
3. Long Context: Practical retention quality matters more than raw token window; evaluate retrieval hybrid vs pure long sequence.
4. Safety / Governance: Anthropic & OpenAI emphasize policy toolchains; open models require integrator adding filters / classifiers.
5. Specialization vs Generality: Domain fine‑tunes (DeepSeek Coder) can surpass generalists on narrow metrics—maintain blended evaluation.
6. Routing: Meta‑model orchestration (Perplexity, emerging agent routers) increasingly outperforms any single static model on heterogeneous workloads.

### Update / Maintenance Notes
- Reassess quarterly against: Chatbot Arena (Arena Elo), HumanEval, MMLU, GSM8K, MT‑Bench, VLM benchmarks (LLaVA‑Bench, VQAv2), and cost metrics ($/1K tokens, latency p95).
- Track deprecations (e.g., GPT‑4 Turbo superseded) & license shifts (Stable Diffusion variants, Llama acceptable use). 
- Capture internal performance deltas in a VERSIONED.md log if you adopt specific pinned checkpoints.
