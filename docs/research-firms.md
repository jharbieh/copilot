## Notes
- Inclusion emphasizes breadth (frontier dev + evaluation + governance). Some orgs span multiple categories (e.g., Anthropic also policy; Hugging Face both platform & evaluation). 
- Verify license & usage restrictions before integrating any open-weight model in production pipelines.

## TODO / Future Additions
- Add emerging regional labs (e.g., MPTI, French & Canadian AI institutes) if they release competitive checkpoints.
- Track evolution of safety benchmarks and red‑teaming consortium findings.
